[![CurseForge Versions](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/1292580.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/one-click-one-block-1c1b)

Adds a little delay after insta-breaking the first block, so you won't accidentally break the next block with an instant mining tool.

## ‚ùî Something Long Missing from Minecraft

There's Efficiency V pickaxe, and there's Haste II beacon; <br>
you even get Drills, Atomic Disassembler, or some more overpowered tools.

But this is always the source of headache:<br>
you misplace a block, you try to correct it, then oops, your favorite tool is so fast!<br>
It digs through the misplaced block and destroys your fishtank.<br>
Now you get water all over the place, the torch and carpets are gone, what a total mess.

Let's look at the keyboard, it (almost) never double types.<br>
The time proves its success, so why don't we put the same thing in Minecraft?

## ‚≠ê Features:

- Configurable delay
- Temporarily disable it with a hotkey
- That's it! Simple and good.
